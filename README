ActiveResource  like RESTClient for java

Typical Usage:

All you need are the url, username, password, scheme and realm. You could choose to leave out properties like username, 
password, scheme and realm if not applicable

RestClient restClient = new RestClientBuilder().withUrl("http://localhost:8080/customers&quot")
                                               .withUserName("username")
                                               .withPassword("password")
                                               .withBasicAuthentication()
                                               .withRealm("realm")
                                               .withFormatHandler(new JSonHandler())
                                               .build();

Create
------

Customer customer = new Customer();
customer.setName("Hari");
restClient.save(customer);

update: Thanks to Marlin Engel, the save now also sets the id on the resource. Keep watching this space for more updates.

Read
----

customer = (Customer) restClient.getById(1, Customer.class);

Update
------

customer.setName("rapa");
restClient.update(customer);

Delete
------

restClient.delete(customer);
